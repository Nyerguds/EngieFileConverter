# Engie File Converter

Engie File Converter is a game formats file converter, mostly aimed towards DOS games from the late 1980s and early 1990s.

It was mostly made as a result of research into file formats for translation projects on [the OldGamesItalia forum](https://www.oldgamesitalia.net/forum/), and for completing and correcting info on [the Shikadi Modding Wiki](https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net/).

This project is released under [WTFPL](LICENSE.md), meaning any part of it can be used without any restriction. The INI format handler included in this project is likewise released under a very permissive license, though one that asks attribution.

However, several pieces of code used in this were taken from external sources, and those files will have their own license added at the top of the file.

The LZW compression code used in this project was written by [Pedro Villarreal](https://github.com/pevillarreal). That project can be found [here](https://github.com/pevillarreal/LzwCompressor).

Engie File Converter
--------------------

This tool was originally created to allow viewing and converting image formats found in the
Nintendo 64 ROM of the Command & Conquer game. Since then, it has evolved into a more general
modding suite supporting a large range of file formats from classic 90's era games.

Created by Maarten 'Nyerguds' Meuris
First release: 04/04/2017

Special thanks to:
-Kamuix and Chad1233 for their help in testing this
-Moon Flower for the help in designing the palette manager

Any icons used in the program (except for the Engineer icon) are based on the

The study of the C&C64 files was made possible by the Universal Game Decompressor
(GEDecompressor), made by SubDrag.

The PC C&C formats were deciphered using documentation written by Vladan Bato.

The compression code used for handling the CPS and LCW formats was gracefully provided by the
people of the Chronoshift (formerly RA++) project. OmniBlade has been particularly helpful.
https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Chronoshift

The LZW compression used in the Westwood Studios game files uses the basic algorithm as described
on Mark Nelson's website: https://marknelson.us/posts/1989/10/01/lzw-data-compression.html
The used LZW code in this tool is based on the C# translation by Pedro Villarreal:
https://github.com/pevillarreal/LzwCompressor
Its code is released under the MIT license, which can be found on its GitHub repository.

The Dynamix LZW decompression code was converted from the C++ code of VOGONS.org user tikalat's
"midi tools v4". It contains no license but I assume the fact he included the code implies that
he doesn't mind it being useful to more people. The license on the attachment on the forum says
"Fair use/fair dealing exception"; not really a license meant for posting your own code under.

The Dynamix LZSHuff decompression was identified thanks to NewRisingSun in that same thread:
https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?p=306003#p306003

The K.O.R.T. image format was decoded thanks to documentation included in the K.O.R.T. savegame
editor written by David Eriksson, aka Edison of 2GooD:
http://www.2good.nu/projekt/korted

The K.O.R.T. BMP format was mapped by TheRuler on the OldGamesItalia forum:
http://www.oldgamesitalia.net/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=16027&view=findpost&p=360174

The code of ScummVM helped a lot to figure out the compression on the Elvira VGA format.
https://www.scummvm.org/

The Mythos Visage format's RLE compression formats were figured out by user Ceiwad of the
shikadi.net modding wiki, who posted his findings here:
http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/Visage_Format
(though the topic has been thoroughly clarified by me since then :p)

The Dune II SHP format was implemented based on a document written by Ultraq, with further
assistance from OmniBlade.

The DaisyField format's decryption was vastly simplified thanks to some hints from CTPAX-X Team.

The Interactive Girls Club bit mask compression was figured out thanks to CTPAX-X Team.

The bulk of the research on the Dynamix SCN/OFF format was done by user Knt47 of the VOGONS.org
forums and Shikadi modding wiki.

The "All Dogs Go To Heaven" format was figured out by Levellass.


Version history:
---------------
This tool started as the CnC64ImageViewer, but later got expanded to a full conversion suite.
At that point, it became the CnC64FileConverter v1.0. As of v1.3, it has been renamed to
Engie File Converter.


Engie File Converter versions:

v1.5.9: (28/04/2022 12:50 CET)
-Fixed error of background colour choice not showing up in "frames to single image" dialog
 if the frames were indexed format.
-Added support for Jazz Jackrabbit fonts.

v1.5.8: (09/10/2021 16:10 CET)
-AdventureSoft icons file: Fixed UI display of dimensions.
-Added internal support for selecting the six CGA palettes from the palette dropdown.
 Like 1bpp, though, this type does not support saving or loading palettes.
-Fixed an error where pixels inside bytes got swapped when pasting on a 4-bpp or 1-bpp picture.
-Cleaned up code in the C&C tileset type.
-Fixed issue with palette saving options in the Westwood WSA type.
-Removed enable/disable ambiguity in save option filters.

v1.5.7: (17/08/2021 14:55 CET)
-All Dogs DB format: added automatic detection for CGA/EGA by testing if any widths exceed 320.
-All Dogs DB format: fixed detection of CGA content in save options.

-Added new high res icon to the editor.
-Removed some old libraries that never got used.

v1.5.6: (17/08/2021 01:46 CET)
-Added tool to change an indexed image's fixed palette.

-Added support for saving completely transparent Dynamix BMP of the SCN type.
-Fixed incorrect loading of 16-colour palettes for Dynamix BMP files.
-Changed standard palette save format to 8-bit rather than 6-bit. When opening the palette editor,
 6-bit palettes will be converted to 8-bit, with an accompanying ini file to confirm its format.

 images with 4-bit data that can be incremented to other indices in an 8-bit image.

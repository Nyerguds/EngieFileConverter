-------------- Created by by Nyerguds (04/04/2017)

This tool allows viewing and saving from and to several file formats found in the Nintendo 64 ROM
of the Command & Conquer game.

The files can be extracted from / inserted into the ROM with the Universal Game Decompressor
(GEDecompressor), made by SubDrag.

Special thanks to Kamuix and Chad1233 for their help in testing this, and to Moon Flower for the
help in designing the palette manager.

Features:
--------
-Supports both opening and saving all classic image types (png/gif/bmp/jpg), the N64's IMG format,
 and game maps and color palettes of both the PC and N64 versions of the game.
-Gives a visual representation of the loaded file, with zoom and adjustable background color.
-Can display the file's color palette, if it has one.
-Can save opened files as any supported format, though some conversions are obviously impossible;
 high-colour images can't be saved as palette, and only maps can be saved as maps.
-Preserves the color palette when saving 4-bit and 8-bit paletted images.
-Supports drag & drop for opening files.
-Can be used as command line converter with the following syntax:
    CnC64FileConverter.exe infile.img outfile.png
-Has utilities to help generate height maps for missions.

Features:
--------
-Supports both opening and saving all classic image types (png/gif/bmp/jpg), the N64's IMG format,
 and game maps and color palettes of both the PC and N64 versions of the game.
-Gives a visual representation of the loaded file, with zoom and adjustable background color.
-Can display the file's color palette, if it has one.
-Can save opened files as any supported format, though some conversions are obviously impossible;
 high-colour images can't be saved as palette, and only maps can be saved as maps.
-Preserves the color palette when saving 4-bit and 8-bit paletted images.
-Supports drag & drop for opening files
-Can be used as command line converter with the following syntax:
    CnC64FileConverter.exe infile.img outfile.png
